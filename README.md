## TODO:
- Begin working on the app's Room controls.
- A database as the backbone of the room system.
- Begin using JQuery.
- Add comments and overall documentation to the code.
- Create images for the basic tools.
- My "OCD" wants the icons' sizes to be powers of two.
- Add Aruni and her gadget.
- Optimize the rendering (even more).

## Features to implement:
- Fully featured roomsystem with anonymous edits.
- More tools: line, path, rectangle, circle.
- Ability to hide and show objects based on their group or some kind of filtering.
- History for undo/redo.
