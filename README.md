# WebR6Editor
 The simple but powerful web-based Rainbow Six: Siege strategy editor.
  ~Developed by: Joni Rapo

## TODO:
- Refactor the code to have less hard coded sections.
- Change how the tint works. (idk how but so a certain player
  could have a certain color assigned to them.)

## Features to implement:
- Saving/loading the creation.
- Ability to hide and show operator-specific utility.
- Export image.
