# WebR6Editor
The simple but useful web-based Rainbow Six: Siege strategy editor.
~Developed by: Joni Rapo

## TODO:
- Add comments and overall documentation to the code.
- Remove the tint feature and replace it with a colored rectangle around the object.
- Add Aruni and her gadget.
- Form contexts around certain modules like the controller and tool-handler
  for hiding a large number of functions under a class.
- Make the objects have a non-zoom related static size which can be altered in some other way.
- Optimize the rendering.

## Features to implement:
- Saving/loading the creation.
- Ability to hide and show operator-specific utility.
- Export image.
- Compress javascript for deployability.
- Portability to other games.
- When loading a new map, set the zoom and translation
  so the map fits in the center of the viewport.
