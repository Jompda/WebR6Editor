# WebR6Editor
The simple but useful web-based Rainbow Six: Siege strategy editor.
~Developed by: Joni Rapo

## TODO:
- Add comments and overall documentation to the code.
- Change how the tint works. (idk how but so a certain player
  could have a certain color assigned to them.)
- Update the maps.
- Add the newest operators and gadgets.
- Form contexts around certain modules like the controller and tool-handler
  for hiding a large number of functions under a class.

## Features to implement:
- Saving/loading the creation.
- Ability to hide and show operator-specific utility.
- Export image.
- Compress javascript for deployability.
