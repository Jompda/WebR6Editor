# WebR6Editor
The simple but useful web-based Rainbow Six: Siege strategy editor.
~Developed by: Joni Rapo

## TODO:
- Proper Room and Slide controls.
- A database as the backbone of the room system.
- Create images for the basic tools.
- My "OCD" wants the icons' sizes to be powers of two.
- Add Aruni and her gadget.
- Optimize the rendering (even more).
- Split the app into two separate parts: viewer and editor.
  The viewer is always preloaded but the editor doesn't necessarily need to be loaded.

## Features to implement:
- Preset viewport position for each slide.
- Fully featured roomsystem with anonymous edits.
- More tools: line, path, rectangle, circle.
- Ability to hide and show objects based on their group or some kind of filtering.
- History for undo/redo.

## Brainstorming:
- Why not use React?
