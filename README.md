The simple but useful web-based Rainbow Six: Siege strategy editor.
~Developed by: Joni Rapo

## TODO:
- Add comments and overall documentation to the code.
- Create a proper toolsystem.
- Create images for the basic tools.
- My "OCD" wants the icons' sizes to be powers of two.
- Add Aruni and her gadget.
- Optimize the rendering (even more).

## Features to implement:
- Ability to edit objects individually.
- Ability to rotate objects.
- More tools: line, path, rectangle, circle.
- Ability to hide and show objects based on their group or some kind of filtering.
- Saving/loading the creation.
- History for undo/redo.
- Export image.
- Portability to other games.
